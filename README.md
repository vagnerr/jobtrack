Simple PHP Web app to track applications for work. Built around year 2000,
so very Web 1.0

Uses php smarty for its template engine.

## What is it

Job Applications Tracker is a web based system using PHP and MySQL that
allows you to keep track of your job applications. The system allows
you to log individual job applications and link them to particular
agents, agencies, and locations, as well as where you saw the role
advertised. You can then attach arbitrary data to a job along with
individual notes each time you talk to an agent. You can then
crossreference all the data allowing you to make informed
decisions on which agents are being helpfull and which are not.

Should you be in a situation where you are required to attend regular
signing on sessions for unemployment then the JSA Report section
will allow you to quickly generate a report of your attempts to
find work. Afterall if you are in the unfortunate position to
be need these reports you probably want to spend your time looking
for work rather than writing reports about it.

## Where can you get it

You can get the latest version from the project homepage on github
( was sourceforge but I moved it over )

## How do you install it

Check the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file for pre-requisits and install details.

## Contributions

Well you **could** suggest patches and fixed, but to be frank this code
is a little long in the tooth now. I am planning to take a look at
rebuilding it with more modern frameworks. This was originally a
project to learn php ( which probably shows ).
