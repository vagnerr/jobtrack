What is it?
-----------

Job Applications Tracker is a web based system using PHP and MySQL that 
allows you to keep track of your job applications. The system allows
you to log individual job applications and link them to particular
agents, agencies, and locations, as well as where you saw the role
advertised. You can then attach arbitrary data to a job along with 
individual notes each time you talk to an agent. You can then 
crossreference all the data allowing you to make informed 
decisions on which agents are being helpfull and which are not.

Should you be in a situation where you are required to attend regular
signing on sessions for unemployment then the JSA Report section
will allow you to quickly generate a report of your attempts to 
find work. Afterall if you are in the unfortunate position to
be need these reports you probably want to spend your time looking
for work rather than writing reports about it.
