Job Applications Tracker (Installation)
=======================================

Prerequisists
-------------

You need the following to get started.

1) A MySQL database version 11.15 or later.
2) A web server with PHP 4.0.6 or later.
3) Smarty 2.4 or later
4) Smarty DatePick plugin (available from smarty.php.net)


Installation
------------

1)  If you have not already done so and need to, follow the install
    instructions for MySQL, PHP, Smarty, and the Smarty DatePick 
    plugin.
2)  Unzip in this package you will find a website directory containing
    three directories.
         configs
         docroot
         templates
    These are the smarty directories of the same name. You will need
    to place the contents of each of these on your web server, along
    with ensuring you have the templates_c directory as required by
    smarty.
3)  In the plugins directory you will find an aditional Smarty plugin
    (resource.skin.php) you will need to copy it to the smarty plugin
    directory. I.e.
             /usr/lib/php/Smarty/plugins/resource.skin.php
4)  Edit the common_setup.php and modify $base to the base location
    for your installation.
5)  Edit the db_setup.php file and fill out the database connection
    details.
6)  Create a new database in MySQL and a new user to access that
    database.
7)  Initialise the database. In the database directory you will find
    an initial database schema. Run that against the database. eg.
        mysql -u database_u -p DATABASENAME < Job-app-initialload.sql

Extra Setup (optional)
-----------

There are some extra configuration options that you can alter if you
need to. These are all in the common_setup.php file

$mark_fake
   This is set to 1 by default. This instructs the application to 
   display "fake" status of jobs and allow you to change that. Usefull
   if you have a quiet week and need to bolster your figures for a job
   seakers agreement. Set this to 0 if you dont need it.

$pager_size
   A number of pages produce a list of jobs. This variable determines
   how many are displayed per page.

$smarty->skin_name
   In the templates directory there is a skins directory in if 
   skin_name is set then the application will look in
      templates/skins/<skin_name>/
   for its templates first before reverting to the defaults.
